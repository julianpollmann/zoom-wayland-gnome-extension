# zoom-wayland-gnome-extension
Small Gnome Shell Extension to enable Zoom Screensharing under Wayland.

Since the Zoom client does not natively support Wayland, Wayland's "safe mode" must be disabled to enable screen sharing.

## Installation
Download zip and copy the folder `**zoomwayland@polyte.de**` into `.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`. Logout and Login, the use Gnome Tweak Tool or https://extensions.gnome.org/local/ to enable it.

## Usage
After installation you'll find a Icon in the Gnome Panel. Activate the Switch to enable Zoom Screensharing. A Message will appear to notice you, that "the System is in an unsecure mode". After Screenshare you can disable the Switch again.
